.. note::

   **This is a SQuaRE delivery note covering use of the Science Platform in Observatory Operations (not the Data Facilities).**

   A Delivery Note is being used to transition a service (or other codebase) from Rubin Construction to Operations in situations where the service is not covered by a requirements document, is not part of the observatory operational readiness milestone, or otherwise lacks a formal process of delivery.

   Its purpose is to document the transition so as to allow Ops-funded developers to continue to maintain and evolve the service, and to allow the service's deployment costs to be covered by Ops infrastructure or funding. It can also be used to describe responsibilities for the service when not a direct continuation of the model used in construction.

   The process is complete when the relevant AD(s) and/or Director reviews the note and the note is published (merged to master).

   **Engineering review: Michael Reuter**
   **Management review:** Wil O'Mullane, Chuck Claver and Bob Blum
